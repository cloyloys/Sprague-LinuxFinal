Notes

I have kali linux installed on virtualbox for the purpose of this final.

After opening and booting linux on my selected VM, I navigated to the terminal and did the following the following:

1) Choosing the directory and creating the script using these commands...
"cd ~/Documents" to change my directory to documents
"touch count.sh" to create the count script
"nano" count.sh to edit the script file contents

2) Making and Testing the Script
"chmod +x count.sh" allowed me to run the script
"./count.sh" executed the script
